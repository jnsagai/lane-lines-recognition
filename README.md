Overview
---
This project is part of Udacoty Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree and aims to detect lane lines in images and videos using Python and OpenCV.

Dependencies
---
If you are running this code using the IPython version ( Jupyter ), you will need to install the following packages:
```
conda install -c anaconda numpy
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge moviepy
conda install -c anaconda ipython
```

In order to execute the python version (.py), you will need to install the following pip packages:
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install moviepy
```

How to run it
---
Insert your images in the "test_images" folder and run CarND_ProjectLaneLines.py. The result images with the lane lines detection will be stores in "test_images_output".
If you want to detect the lane line in videos instead, you should save your videos in the "test_videos" folder, and after running CarND_ProjectLaneLinesWithVideo.py the result videos will be stored in "test_videos_output"
